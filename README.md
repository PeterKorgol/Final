In this project, I used machine learning to try and predict the alcohol content of red wine based on chemical data. Using PyCaret made the process very simple, as I was able to compare models, tune them, evaluate performance, and make predictions with only a few lines of code. After testing many different models, LightGBM ended up being the best-performing model and gave the most accurate results when predicting alcohol percentages.
